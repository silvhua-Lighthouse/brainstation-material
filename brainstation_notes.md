# 2024-05-01
## CSS and VS Code Demo
Instructor: Joseph Young

* Extensions such as `Mithril Emmet` helps create script templates such as for HTML. `shift + !`.
* Any HTML page should only have one h1 heading.

## CSS Specificity and Complex Selectors
Instructor: Ed Baafi

Selector Type | example | Description
--- | ---- | ---
Multiple selectors | `p.red-paragraph.special` | The second `.` acts like "and"
Grouped selectors | `p.red-paragraph, p.special` | `,` acts like "or"
Descendent selector | `p .red-paragraph` | The space indicates that the element to the left is the ancestor and the element to the right is the descendent.
Child selector | `div.my-parent > div` | the `>` indicates we are looking for that element that is a **direct** child of the thing on the left. It is more granular than the descendant selector.

### Descendant selectors  

`index.html`
```html
<p>
    <span class="red-text">
        I am dark red
    </span>
</p>
<span class="red-text">
    I am dark red
</span>
```

`style.css`
```css
p .red-text { 
    color: darkred;
}

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```
# 2024-05-02 CSS Units
Instructor: Ed

## The Relative Units
Unit | Description | When to use
--- | --- | ---
% | Relative to the containing block (parent block) | Use if at all possible. Containing block needs to have a value set. Great for defining widths.
em | Relative to the font-size of the current element. | Preferable to use for padding and margin as well as font size. 
rem | Relative to root font size. | Should be used 99.9% of the time for font size. Setting font size using rem is better for those with accessibility needs.
vh, vw | Relative to 1% of the viewport height/width. Viewport is the browser window. | Great for when you want to take up a certain percentage of the viewport. Not used as often as %. 
vmin | Relative to 1% of the viewport smallest side | [Same as vh, vw]
vmax | Relative to 1% of the viewport largest side | [Same as vh, vw]

* If no font size is set, it is inherited.
* Sometimes browser has preset styles which may cause conflicts such as with h2. Best practice to have control over what the view sees is to explicitely set font size.

### Rule of Thumb:
- Use % for layout and structure of your page, anything that you can think of being flexible, either based on responsiveness to browser screen or other containers
- Use rem for margins, paddings and font-sizes.
- For zooming accessibility using rems for all sizes in CSS, including media query breakpoints, is usually enough to avoid problems
- Use vw, vh for things that need to be relative to browser width or height (aka viewport)
- Use px only if you are sure it can't be a relative value
- Often height can be left unset (auto) so that the element's height is based on its content (I removed the height from the cards in the demo to show this)
- Note: (advanced) for the question about setting a max margin or padding so that it can be based on rem or em but not go over a set value, you can use min() (counterintuitive because we're trying to set a max value, that's why I had to thin about it).
    - Consider margin: min(30px, 1rem); which sets the margin to the minimum of the values 30px and 1rem.
    - When 1rem (based on 1X root font size) is less than 30px, the margin will be set to 1rem (the minimum of the two numbers) but when 1rem is greater than 30px, the margin will be set to 30px (the minimum of the two)

## Box Model + Chrome Dev Tools
Instructor: Jasleen

* Recommended unit for borders is px.

### Box-sizing property
* Defines how the browser should calculate the total width and height of an element.

value | description
--- | ---
`content-box` (default) | Width and height affect the content box, not the padding or margin.
`border-box` | Content box width/height include the padding and border. Margin doesn't affect the width/height calculation.

# 2024-05-03 Display
Instructor: Joseph Young

Value | Description | Notes
--- | ---- | ---
`block` | | Greedy
`inline` | | Does not accept height/width. 
`inline-block` |  | allows us to define margins, heights, etc.
`none` | Element is not displayed and doesn't take up space, unlike `visibility: hidden`.

## Default display

value | description
--- | ---
block | `div`, `p`, header tags
inline-block | `img` and `button`
inline | `span` and `a`

* Technically, `img`'s default display is inline but it acts more like inline-block.


### How to center inline-block elements:
```css
margin: 0 auto;
width: fit-content;
```
OR
```css
text-align: center;
```

# 2024-05-03 BEM demo
Instructor: Jasleen

```css
.container {
    width: calc(33% - 20px)
}
```
CSS property | Description | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`overflow: auto` | To clip content and provide scrollbar

# 2024-05-06 
## Flexbox
Instructor: Joseph Young

* Flexbox is based on 2 axes:
    * Main axis: Default is x-axis
    * Cross axis: Default is y-axis
* 4 possible values for `flex-direction` property:
    * row (default)
    * row-reverse
    * column
    * column-reverse
* possible values for `justify-content` property:
    * flex-start
    * flex-end
    * center
    * space-between
    * space-around
    * space-evenly
* `align-items` property is for the cross-axis (default vertical)
* `align-content` property is for the cross-axis (default vertical)
    * acronym: JCAlI
* `flex-wrap`
* When items have a main axis of vertical with flex-wrap, to prevent items from bleeding out of the container:
    * Use `flex-wrap`, OR
    * Set container height to 100%
* `align-self`
* `flex-flow`: Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`
    `flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>`

## Order
* By default, all child elements have an index of 0.
* If the order of elements is the same, go by the order in which they are listed in the HTML.

# CAP Workshop: Telling Your Story
Instructor: Julia Osmar

* About Julia
    * Former food stylist.
    * Leads BrainStation's Experience team.
* Breakout room: Practised pitch with Amie Liang
    * She has a background in retail banking and was a financial analyst.
* To be memorable, lead with your "why", not with your skills.

## Understanding your path activity

Opening (1 sentence) | Why did you start? | What did you learn? | Fave aspect of the role/experience? | Least fave aspect
--- | ---- | --- | --- | ---
Kinesiologist | I have a mission of improving people's health. | I learned that to help people improve their health, you need to help them change their behaviour. | I loved helping people get stronger and move pain-free. | I realized that many workplace injuries could have been prevented if people were stronger and moved better.
Personal trainer | I wanted to help people take a proactive approach to health. | I learned that to succeed as a fitness professional, you need to develop business skills. | I loved helping clients get better results than they would have gotten on their own. | I didn't like having to worry my business: getting and retaining clients.
Freelance data scientist | Someone in my network gave me the opportunity to develop a specific software. | I learned how to use AWS to deploy an app and how to implement CI/CD. | I loved writing code for a real-life business use case. | I didn't have colleagues to go to for help.

## Crafting your story
1. Opening: "I am ..." -> I am a kinesiologist-turned-developer
2. Why are you interested in this field of work: Short motivational story. 
    * I realized that to help people improve their health, you need to support behaviour change.
    * To improve population health, you need to help people who aren't fitness enthusiasts.
    * I want to use data and tech to make my impact on a large scale.
3. Relevant skills/experiences: 1-2 supporting experiences.
4. Closer: "Really excited to do ..."

* Types of audience dictates length of pitch
    * small group: 30-60 sec
    * interview/1-to-1: 2-5 min

## Networking
* Go with a goal in mind. e.g.
    * Meet 1 person.
    * Meet 1 person at this company.
* Coffee chats: Get others talking about themselves and offer a clear reason for reaching out.
* Get to know someone, don't just ask for help.
* How can you help them?
* Establish next steps.
    * Follow up on LinkedIn or email.
    * Have them review your portfolio.

# 2024-05-08 Position & float
Instructor: Joseph

## Position
value | Description | Notes
--- | ---- | ---
static | Default | Analogous to a book on a bookshelf. You can't move a book without disturbing the order.
relative | Analogous to your place in a queue being saved.
absolute | Imagine a parent holding a child and walking. The child's position remains the same relative to the parent as the parent walks. If no parent with position `static` exists, then the position is relative to the document. No space is held for the element.
fixed | Position relative to the viewport.
sticky | Acts like absolute or fixed depending on where parent container is in the viewport.

## Float
* Equivalent to text wrapping around images in Word and that's all it should be used for. It should not be used for positioning elements.
* Clearfix helps fix items bleeding from their container.

## z-index
* Similar to `order` in flex in that everything has default value of 0. The higher the value, the more in front it is.
* z-index affects position in the z-plane while order in the xy-plane.

# 2024-05-08 Sass
Instructor: Ed

* Mixins are the equivalent of functions.
* Focus more on variables and mixins for this course. 
* `@extend` is not as useful in this course because it is not as aligned with BEM. 
    * It is meant to be used for allowing a selector to inherit properties from its parent.
* `&` is equivalent to ` ` and ` > ` in CSS selectors.
*

## BEM review
* BEM = block__element--modifier
* Something that stands alone and is re-usable is a block. Otherwise, it is an element.
* All elements have a parent that has a class.
* `block__element`: How we name an element.
* `block--modifier`: How we name a block's modifier.
* `block__element--modifier`: How we name an element's modifier.

## Partials
`partials/_colors.scss` (filename must have underscore in front)
```scss
$primary: #FFF;
```

`main.scss`
```scss
@use 'partials/colors';

body {
    color: colors.$primary;
}
```
Alternative `main.scss` to simplify the script:
```scss
@use 'partials/colors' as *;
@use 'partials/mixins' as *;

body {
    color: $primary;
}
```
# 2024-05-09 Typography & Fonts
Instructor: Ed

* A typeface is a collection of letters and symbols.
* A font is a specific size, weight, or style of a type face.
    * Back in the days of the printing press, you needed a separate tile for every variation of a letter, e.g. upper case, bold, size.
* Font-family is synonym for typeface.

Families of typefaces:
* All fall into one of these:
    * Serif
    * Sans-serif 
* Other classes:
    * Monospace
    * Cursive
    * Fantasy

Adjusting font size
* Use a modular scale: pick a modifying unit and scale up your rem units based on this modifier.
    * e.g. `p` and `h6` can be the same size, then multiply by 1.4 for the next level.
* `@font-face` allows you to load a custom font-family. Mandatory properties:
    * `font-family`
    * `src`

## `@font-face`
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Gugi';
    src: url('path/to/Gugi-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');
}

.success {
    font-family: 'Gugi';
}
```
* The `format` value for the font-family isn't always the same as the file extension.
* If wanting a different `font-weight` or `font-style`, the files used are different than for default:
    * Specify these properities in the `@font-face` block.
    * Load the appropriate file
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Gugi';
    src: url('path/to/gugi-bold-italic.woff2') format('woff2');
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: italic;
}
```
* `woff` and `woff2` file types are optimized for performance and have excellent browser support.
    * Safari is the one browser that doesn't automatically update fonts.
    * `caniuse.com` checks for browser support. 

* `woff2` is the best format. Use `woff` as the fallback option.
    * Browser checks the first option in `src` property before checkin the next on the list.
```
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Gugi';
    src: url('path/to/Gugi-Regular.woff2') format('woff2'), 
        url('path/to/Gugi-Regular.woff') format('woff')
}
```
Considerations for choosing fonts:
* Language support
* Ligature support
    * How many different combinations of letters have the letters connected?
    * Decided upon by designed.
* File size

## At-rules for CSS
* Tells the browser how to behave.
* Can be used to declare reusable CSS
* Include the next CSS statement

* **Note**: If using SCSS file, the final CSS file MUST reference the font family files to work. Beware if using different relative paths.

# 2024-05-09 CSS Animations

* border-radius
* color
* opacity

* CSS Transforms apply to an element.

## Keyframe animations
* Keyframes are a way to set markers at different times from 0 to 100%, which we use to change CSS property values.
* animation can run when the page loads. After, would need to reload the page to see the animation.

```css
@keyframes color-change {
    from {background-color: red;}
    to {background-color: blue;}
}

.animated-element {
    animation: color-change 5s;
}
```
* `+` in a selector is the same as "and".
* `pointer-events: none` allows for smoother transition to `:hover` state.
* Too much animation can make the code hard for developers to read and hard for viewed due to accesibility issues.

# 2024-05-10 Responsive design
Instructor: Ed

* Mobile-first design philosophy: Design for the mobile first as it is harder due to the smaller screen.

Important things:
* Media queries 
* Viewport meta tags are in the HTML head

## Media queries

Property | Description | Notes
--- | ---- | ---
`min-width`
`max-width`
`min-height`
`max-height`
`orientation=portrait`
`orientation=landscape`

* Most of the time, we just use the page width is the media query
* Media type includes print or screen

* SVG is the preferred image type for responsive design
* Even when using mobile-first design, it is important to thinking about what the site will look like on different sites before implementing.
* Mobile-first implementation means that the default display is for mobile.
* When a selector is repeated, the rules that are lowest on the page are applied.

# 2024-05-10 Git Branching
Instructor: Jasleen

* Git branches can be used to work on different blocks of a webpage, e.g. header has its own branch.
* Best practice for a new branch to contain commits related to a specific feature or update in your project.

Command | Description | Notes
--- | ---- | ---
`git branch` | Show branches
`git checkout -b <branchname>` or `git switch -c <branchname>` | Creates a new local branch and switches to that branch.
`git checkout <branchname>` | Switches to an existing branch.
`git merge <branchname>` | Merges the branch into the current branch.
`git pull` | Pulls the latest updates from `main` branch.
`git rebase main` | Can be used to reverse some changes (unclear about details). Should only be done when the branch has nothing that hasn't been pushed or stashed.
`git stash` | Store the line of code.
`git stash pop` | Restore the line of code from `git stash`.
`git stash list` | Show the stash list.

Branch naming conventions:
* Concise
* Descriptive of the code that you are writing on that branch.

* Either a pull request or merge can be used to update main branch when working on your own on a project.

# 2024-05-13 Morning Challenges
Instructor: Daniil Molodkov
From Toronto

* Word problems
* Debugging code
* Technical questions of varying skill levels

## Word problems
Meant to convey your thought process without the need to write semantic code. 

e.g. If you have a 7 minute hourglass and an 11 minute hourglass, how can you measure exactly 15 minutes.

## Technical questions
1. Think about the question and what is being asked of you.
2. Determine the important factors of the questions and what type of result you should be delivering.
3. Can clarify the requirements of the question by writing an input/output or starting/finishing values.
4. Write your solution in plain english before attempting to write a code solution.
5. Keep in mind there is always more than 1 way to solve a problem. Sometimes the first solution isn't the best.

# 2024-05-13 Thinking like a Programmer
Instructor: Roberta Nin Feliz
* In New York
* Used to work at Peloton

## Flow charts
* Every function call takes up memory, so infinite loops eventually lead to an error message.

# 2024-05-14 JavaScript Fundamentals
Instructor: Roberta

* types of programming languages:
    * Interpreted/higher level: e.g. Python, JavaScript
    * Machine/compiled 
* Originally, JS could only be run in browser so you needed something else in the backend. Now, something like Node allows JS to be run in the backend as well.
* JS allows for asynchronous processes on the web.

## Data Types
* There is a separate number data type for very large numbers (not int or float) to reduce memory.
* `var` is not a favoured way to declare variables because it gets hoisted to the top of the program

## Operators
* In a for loop, use post - increment operator, e.g. `i++`
* Pre-increment operator: Use it when you need the increment to happen before something happens, e.g. when using `console.log`

## Comparison operators
* `===` means strictly equals, requiring both the value and data type to be the same. 
    * `==` is not the same.

# 2024-05-14 Data Structure
Instructor: Jasleen

* Non-primative data types can contain multiple values.

# 2024-05-15 Control flow
Instructor: Daniil
* `if/else` statements must evaluate to a boolean, whereas `switch`statements do not.

# 2024-05-15 Functions
Instructor: Jasleen

* We will lose marks if we return an expression without initializing the variable to return
