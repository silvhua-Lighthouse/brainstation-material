# 2024-05-01
## CSS and VS Code Demo
Instructor: Joseph Young

* Extensions such as `Mithril Emmet` helps create script templates such as for HTML. `shift + !`.
* Any HTML page should only have one h1 heading.

## CSS Specificity and Complex Selectors
Instructor: Ed Baafi

Selector Type | example | Description
--- | ---- | ---
Multiple selectors | `p.red-paragraph.special` | The second `.` acts like "and"
Grouped selectors | `p.red-paragraph, p.special` | `,` acts like "or"
Descendent selector | `p .red-paragraph` | The space indicates that the element to the left is the ancestor and the element to the right is the descendent.
Child selector | `div.my-parent > div` | the `>` indicates we are looking for that element that is a **direct** child of the thing on the left. It is more granular than the descendant selector.

### Descendant selectors  

`index.html`
```html
<p>
    <span class="red-text">
        I am dark red
    </span>
</p>
<span class="red-text">
    I am dark red
</span>
```

`style.css`
```css
p .red-text { 
    color: darkred;
}

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```
# 2024-05-02 CSS Units
Instructor: Ed

## The Relative Units
Unit | Description | When to use
--- | --- | ---
% | Relative to the containing block (parent block) | Use if at all possible. Containing block needs to have a value set. Great for defining widths.
em | Relative to the font-size of the current element. | Preferable to use for padding and margin as well as font size. 
rem | Relative to root font size. | Should be used 99.9% of the time for font size. Setting font size using rem is better for those with accessibility needs.
vh, vw | Relative to 1% of the viewport height/width. Viewport is the browser window. | Great for when you want to take up a certain percentage of the viewport. Not used as often as %. 
vmin | Relative to 1% of the viewport smallest side | [Same as vh, vw]
vmax | Relative to 1% of the viewport largest side | [Same as vh, vw]

* If no font size is set, it is inherited.
* Sometimes browser has preset styles which may cause conflicts such as with h2. Best practice to have control over what the view sees is to explicitely set font size.

### Rule of Thumb:
- Use % for layout and structure of your page, anything that you can think of being flexible, either based on responsiveness to browser screen or other containers
- Use rem for margins, paddings and font-sizes.
- For zooming accessibility using rems for all sizes in CSS, including media query breakpoints, is usually enough to avoid problems
- Use vw, vh for things that need to be relative to browser width or height (aka viewport)
- Use px only if you are sure it can't be a relative value
- Often height can be left unset (auto) so that the element's height is based on its content (I removed the height from the cards in the demo to show this)
- Note: (advanced) for the question about setting a max margin or padding so that it can be based on rem or em but not go over a set value, you can use min() (counterintuitive because we're trying to set a max value, that's why I had to thin about it).
    - Consider margin: min(30px, 1rem); which sets the margin to the minimum of the values 30px and 1rem.
    - When 1rem (based on 1X root font size) is less than 30px, the margin will be set to 1rem (the minimum of the two numbers) but when 1rem is greater than 30px, the margin will be set to 30px (the minimum of the two)

## Box Model + Chrome Dev Tools
Instructor: Jasleen

* Recommended unit for borders is px.

### Box-sizing property
* Defines how the browser should calculate the total width and height of an element.

value | description
--- | ---
`content-box` (default) | Width and height affect the content box, not the padding or margin.
`border-box` | Content box width/height include the padding and border. Margin doesn't affect the width/height calculation.

# 2024-05-03 Display
Instructor: Joseph Young

Value | Description | Notes
--- | ---- | ---
`block` | | Greedy
`inline` | | Does not accept height/width. 
`inline-block` |  | allows us to define margins, heights, etc.
`none` | Element is not displayed and doesn't take up space, unlike `visibility: hidden`.

## Default display

value | description
--- | ---
block | `div`, `p`, header tags
inline-block | `img` and `button`
inline | `span` and `a`

* Technically, `img`'s default display is inline but it acts more like inline-block.


### How to center inline-block elements:
```css
margin: 0 auto;
width: fit-content;
```
OR
```css
text-align: center;
```

# 2024-05-03 BEM demo
Instructor: Jasleen

```css
.container {
    width: calc(33% - 20px)
}
```
CSS property | Description | Notes
--- | --- | ---
`overflow: auto` | To clip content and provide scrollbar

# 2024-05-06 
## Flexbox
Instructor: Joseph Young

* Flexbox is based on 2 axes:
    * Main axis: Default is x-axis
    * Cross axis: Default is y-axis
* 4 possible values for `flex-direction` property:
    * row (default)
    * row-reverse
    * column
    * column-reverse
* possible values for `justify-content` property:
    * flex-start
    * flex-end
    * center
    * space-between
    * space-around
    * space-evenly
* `align-items` property is for the cross-axis (default vertical)
* `align-content` property is for the cross-axis (default vertical)
    * acronym: JCAlI
* `flex-wrap`
* When items have a main axis of vertical with flex-wrap, to prevent items from bleeding out of the container:
    * Use `flex-wrap`, OR
    * Set container height to 100%
* `align-self`
* `flex-flow`: Shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`
    `flex-flow: <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>`

## Order
* By default, all child elements have an index of 0.
* If the order of elements is the same, go by the order in which they are listed in the HTML.

# CAP Workshop: Telling Your Story
Instructor: Julia Osmar

* About Julia
    * Former food stylist.
    * Leads BrainStation's Experience team.
* Breakout room: Practised pitch with Amie Liang
    * She has a background in retail banking and was a financial analyst.
* To be memorable, lead with your "why", not with your skills.

## Understanding your path activity

Opening (1 sentence) | Why did you start? | What did you learn? | Fave aspect of the role/experience? | Least fave aspect
--- | ---- | --- | --- | ---
Kinesiologist | I have a mission of improving people's health. | I learned that to help people improve their health, you need to help them change their behaviour. | I loved helping people get stronger and move pain-free. | I realized that many workplace injuries could have been prevented if people were stronger and moved better.
Personal trainer | I wanted to help people take a proactive approach to health. | I learned that to succeed as a fitness professional, you need to develop business skills. | I loved helping clients get better results than they would have gotten on their own. | I didn't like having to worry my business: getting and retaining clients.
Freelance data scientist | Someone in my network gave me the opportunity to develop a specific software. | I learned how to use AWS to deploy an app and how to implement CI/CD. | I loved writing code for a real-life business use case. | I didn't have colleagues to go to for help.

## Crafting your story
1. Opening: "I am ..." -> I am a kinesiologist-turned-developer
2. Why are you interested in this field of work: Short motivational story. 
    * I realized that to help people improve their health, you need to support behaviour change.
    * To improve population health, you need to help people who aren't fitness enthusiasts.
    * I want to use data and tech to make my impact on a large scale.
3. Relevant skills/experiences: 1-2 supporting experiences.
4. Closer: "Really excited to do ..."

* Types of audience dictates length of pitch
    * small group: 30-60 sec
    * interview/1-to-1: 2-5 min

## Networking
* Go with a goal in mind. e.g.
    * Meet 1 person.
    * Meet 1 person at this company.
* Coffee chats: Get others talking about themselves and offer a clear reason for reaching out.
* Get to know someone, don't just ask for help.
* How can you help them?
* Establish next steps.
    * Follow up on LinkedIn or email.
