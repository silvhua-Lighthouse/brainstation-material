# 2024-05-01
## CSS and VS Code Demo
Instructor: Joseph Young

* Extensions such as `Mithril Emmet` helps create script templates such as for HTML. `shift + !`.
* Any HTML page should only have one h1 heading.

## CSS Specificity and Complex Selectors
Instructor: Ed Baafi

Selector Type | example | Description
--- | ---- | ---
Multiple selectors | `p.red-paragraph.special` | The second `.` acts like "and"
Grouped selectors | `p.red-paragraph, p.special` | `,` acts like "or"
Descendent selector | `p .red-paragraph` | The space indicates that the element to the left is the ancestor and the element to the right is the descendent.
Child selector | `div.my-parent > div` | the `>` indicates we are looking for that element that is a **direct** child of the thing on the left. It is more granular than the descendant selector.

### Descendant selectors  

`index.html`
```html
<p>
    <span class="red-text">
        I am dark red
    </span>
</p>
<span class="red-text">
    I am dark red
</span>
```

`style.css`
```css
p .red-text { 
    color: darkred;
}

.red-text {
    color: red;
}
```
